-- Email slice 8b (conversation assignment) + 8c (per-user read state).
--
-- 8b: EmailThread is the new normalised home for per-CONVERSATION workflow
-- state (assignee, shared snooze, archive) - Email.thread_id used to be a bare,
-- FK-less TEXT column left over from the deleted Gmail integration; nothing
-- wrote it (verified live: 0 of 130 rows on staging carried a non-null value),
-- so there was no real thread to hang assignment off. Also adds
-- emails.sent_by_user_id (who sent it, stamped at send by the compose path).
--
-- 8c: EmailReadState replaces the shared Email.unread column as the source of
-- truth for "has THIS user read this message" - a row's existence means read,
-- absence means unread for that user. `unread` is left in the table as dead
-- weight for a later cleanup pass; nothing this slice touches reads or writes
-- it as truth any more (see the Prisma model comments).
--
-- BACKFILL (verified against live staging data,
-- before writing this):
--   select count(*), count(*) filter (where thread_id is not null),
--          count(*) filter (where direction is null)
--   from emails;
--   -> 130 total, 0 with a thread_id, 130 with direction IS NULL. So every
--   existing row gets its OWN EmailThread (no real grouping to preserve),
--   exactly the plan's documented fallback for a near-zero thread_id count.
--
--   The plan's assumption that every direction-null row is ServWave-sent
--   ('out') does NOT hold: two rows are genuine inbound mail (folder='inbox',
--   external senders - a COI request and a vendor shipment update, both
--   predating the Gmail-integration deletion). Blindly setting every row to
--   'out' would mislabel those two as sent-by-us. `folder` is the actual
--   authoritative signal already recorded on every row (only 'inbox'/'sent'
--   values exist), so the backfill derives direction FROM folder instead of
--   assuming the plan's flat default.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT: CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS; FKs behind pg_constraint
--   existence checks; ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS; every backfill UPDATE/INSERT
--   is guarded so a second run touches nothing.
-- PORTABLE: vanilla postgres:16 (CI migration-check) - the only Supabase-role
--   touches are the anon/authenticated REVOKEs, guarded behind pg_roles checks.
