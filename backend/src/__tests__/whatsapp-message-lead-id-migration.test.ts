/**
 * Pins the WhatsAppMessage.lead_id migration (20260804200000) to schema.prisma,
 * the way permissions-technician-communication-backfill.test.ts pins its sibling
 * 20260804210000. Only that sibling had a pin, and this is the riskier of the
 * two: it adds a COLUMN, an INDEX and a FOREIGN KEY, so any disagreement with
 * the schema is drift - and drift fails the DEPLOY, not the PR.
 *
 * WHY THE COLUMN EXISTS: before it, the four comm channels had three different
 * anchor shapes and whatsapp_messages carried job_id with NO lead_id at all. One
 * shared visibility predicate cannot ride three shapes, and copying the emails
 * fragment onto whatsapp_messages would have matched NOTHING rather than failing
 * loudly - a filter that looks correct and hides everything.
 *
 * Verified read-only against the live staging DB (shared staging) while
 * writing this: whatsapp_messages has no lead_id today, and messages_lead_id_fkey
 * is `ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE SET NULL` - which is what this migration
 * mirrors and what the assertions below require.
