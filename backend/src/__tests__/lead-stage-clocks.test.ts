/**
 * Lead stage clocks — spec #1751, decisions D2, D3, D6 and D7.
 *
 * A business owner wants three durations out of this product: lead-in to first contact, first
 * contact to a booked walkthrough, and completed walkthrough to sent estimate. None was
 * computable, because nothing recorded the moment a lead reached a stage.
 *
 * Driven through the HTTP API against the real Express app with Prisma mocked — the seam the
 * backend suite already uses in roughly 530 files. Nothing below reaches for the shape of a
 * helper, deliberately: D3 turns "is the walkthrough complete" into THREE fields, and a test
 * welded to one of them would have to be rewritten by the next person who touches this.
 *
 * Three of these are written as invariants rather than examples, because each is a defect the
 * spec exists to prevent: MONOTONICITY, NON-DESTRUCTION and PROVENANCE. They are labelled below.
