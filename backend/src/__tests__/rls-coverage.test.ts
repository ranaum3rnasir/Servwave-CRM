/**
 * COVERAGE RATCHET for the tenant RLS backstop.
 *
 * rls-isolation.test.ts proves the tenant_isolation policy SHAPE is sound, but
 * it builds its own synthetic table to do it - so a real table that ships with
 * no policy at all passes that suite untouched. That is not hypothetical: it is
 * exactly how custom_field_definitions shipped unprotected in SRVW-114 slice 1,
 * and how automation_rules, automation_runs, job_line_items and org_tax_rates
 * reached prod with relrowsecurity=false (issue #1276).
 *
 * The root cause is that 20260703000100_tenant_rls ENUMERATES its tables by
 * hand and nothing ever compares that list against the real schema. This suite
 * is that comparison: it reads pg_class/pg_policies on the freshly-migrated
 * database and fails when any org-scoped table lacks the backstop. A new table
 * with an organization_id column now cannot merge without either a policy or a
 * deliberate, documented entry in GLOBAL_BY_DESIGN below.
 *
 * Runs in the `Database (migrations + RLS)` CI job against the migrated-but-
 * unseeded throwaway Postgres, and skips locally when TEST_DATABASE_URL is
 * unset. Read-only - no DDL, so unlike its sibling suites it cannot race on the
 * shared cluster's system catalog.

 * The canonical tenant_isolation predicate, as Postgres normalizes it back out

/**
 * Tables that carry an organization_id column but are GLOBAL by design, and

 * decision - justify it in a comment.
 *
 * - email_suppressions: a hard bounce or spam complaint is a property of the
 *   ADDRESS, not of the org that happened to trigger it. The suppression gate
 *   (lib/email-suppression.ts) reads by {address, category} with no org filter,
 *   and the table's unique key is likewise ([address, category]) across all
 *   orgs; organization_id is nullable provenance, not a tenancy scope. Under
 *   tenant_isolation the gate would stop seeing another org's suppression rows
 *   and would happily re-send to an address that already hard-bounced, which
 *   is a deliverability hazard, not an isolation win. Note this table does not
 *   exist yet on this branch - it ships with the unmerged email slice 4 - so
 *   this entry is pre-emptive and currently matches nothing.
