// read + perform the walkthrough on their assigned lead, upload/download attachments, and the
// infra reads the app shell needs. `perform_walkthrough` is a NEW narrow capability that
// replaces the broad `update Lead` a tech used to hold via OWN_WALKTHROUGH ("the only thing a
// tech does on a lead"). `complete Job` (own job) was restored as a role default so a tech can
// close out their own work directly. Everything else (create/update Job·Invoice·Lead, the
// intermediate advance verbs en_route/arrive/start, record_payment) remains removed from the
// role default and is an opt-in per-user toggle.
