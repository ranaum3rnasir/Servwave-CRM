/**
 * PR 3 of the technician-ownership spec
 * (md_files/specs/permissions/2026-08-04-technician-ownership-and-creator-tracking.md).
 *
 * THE RULE: creation confers control. A user who creates a job has full control over it -
 * permanently, even after a dispatcher reassigns the work away from them. The rule only ever ADDS
 * access; higher-tier roles reach the same rows through their own org-wide grants.
 *
 * This file drives the rule through the ROUTES, not through the ability object, because the ability
 * object was never the thing that was wrong: `canDo(action,'Job')` is subject-level, and the
 * per-instance checks in the controllers were all keyed on the READ scope. With `read Job` widened
 * to "assigned OR created by me", a read-scoped per-instance check would have handed every assigned
 * technician the creator's whole surface. Only a request can show that.
 *
 * The three principals below are the whole design:
 *
 *   ASSIGNED_JOB  - assigned to the technician, created by someone else. Money is READABLE
 *                   (`read Pricing`), notes/tags/verbs work, and every creator-only route is 403.
 *   CREATED_JOB   - created by the technician and NOT assigned to them. This is the permanence
 *                   property: full control survives being taken off the job.
 *   FOREIGN_JOB   - another technician's job, neither assigned nor created. Closed entirely.
 *
 * Prisma is mocked (setup.ts), so `job.findFirst` - the query every per-instance scope check runs -
 * is wired through `mockScopedFindFirst`, which really evaluates the `where` fragment against the
 * fixture. Without it the mock would answer "visible" to every fragment and none of these tests
 * could fail.
