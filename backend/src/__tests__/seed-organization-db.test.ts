   The organization seed actually lands the Alpha org.

   PREVIOUSLY A CI STEP - a raw `docker exec ... psql -tA -c` piped into a shell
   `if [ "$COUNT" != "1" ]`. That works, but when it failed it printed
   "Expected 1 Alpha org row, got 0" with no indication of what the table did
   contain, and it could only ever run inside CI.

   Same assertion, as a test: it names what it found on failure, and anyone with
   a throwaway Postgres can run it locally.

   Requires a seeded throwaway database - runs in the `database` CI job after
   `prisma migrate deploy` + `tsx src/seed-organization.ts`, and skips when
   TEST_DATABASE_URL is unset (same idiom as rls-isolation.test.ts).
