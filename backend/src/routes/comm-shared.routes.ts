/**
 * Communication endpoints that belong to no single feature, deliberately WITHOUT
 * a requireFeature gate. Authentication and CASL still apply - only the plan
 * axis is absent, because no single plan key is right for them.
 *
 * - /unread-counts returns one payload spanning three channels: sms and whatsapp
 *   belong to PRO `phone`, email to STARTER `email`. Gating the route on either
 *   key would blank the other module's badge for an org that pays for it, so the
 *   entitlement decision moves INTO the controller: it reports 0 for a channel
 *   the org lacks and skips that channel's query entirely (see getUnreadCounts).
 * - /team-members is the org's own user directory reshaped for the messaging
 *   surfaces. The email composer (emailing a teammate or a group) and the phone
 *   call-groups screen both read it, so gating it on either key breaks the other.
 *   It exposes nothing a member cannot already see - technicians hold org-wide
 *   `read User` by default.
 *
 * Path-scoped like its sibling comm-* routers so it cannot intercept traffic for
 * routes it does not own on the shared /api/communication base.
