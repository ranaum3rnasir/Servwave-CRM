/**
 * Job list facet registry (Task 10). Exported as a plain static array, NOT a
 * function of scopeWhere — unlike Leads (lead.filters.ts) — because none of
 * these facets are scope-sensitive.
 *
 * The crew filters (`assigned_to` / `department_id`) are deliberately NOT
 * here. They target the same `assignees` relation that
 * `scopeWhereForReq(req, 'Job')` uses to enforce row-scope (e.g. a
 * TECHNICIAN's OWN_JOB read grant sets `where.assignees.some.user_id =
 * <self>`). Routing them through the generic `relationSome` helper would
 * merge attacker-supplied query values into that SAME `.some` clause,
 * OVERWRITING `user_id: <self>` — an RBAC bypass / cross-user data leak. The
 * pre-existing hand-rolled code in `buildJobListWhere`
 * (job.controller.ts) already composes them safely (AND-append a SEPARATE
 * `{ assignees: { some: ... } }` clause whenever a role-scoped
 * `where.assignees` already exists); Task 10 keeps that block, hand-rolled,
 * in the controller — only made array-capable — rather than porting it into
 * this registry. This mirrors how Leads kept its scope-sensitive
 * `assigned_to` facet out of the shared engine's blind spot via a
 * `leadFacets(scopeWhere)` factory; Jobs' safest equivalent is simply not
 * making it a facet at all.
 *
 * `param` names here are the wire contract the frontend registry (Task 11)
 * must match.
