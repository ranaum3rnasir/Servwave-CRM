/**
 * deactivation.ts — strip a deactivated user out of the two task people-lists.
 *
 * `assignee_ids` / `watcher_ids` are Postgres uuid arrays, and an array carries no foreign key,
 * so nothing in the database removes a user's id when that user is deactivated. Readers tolerate
 * the miss (`name: null`), which stops the UI crashing but leaves a task assigned to somebody who
 * no longer works here. A task whose ONLY assignee is deactivated is the bad case: it satisfies
 * the ">= 1 assignee" invariant while being assigned to nobody real, so it drops off every
 * workload view and nobody is accountable for it.
 *
 * Deactivation, not deletion, is the trigger: a User is referenced from too many relations to be
 * deletable (see DELETE_BLOCKING_RELATIONS), so `is_active: false` is the only way a seat is ever
 * freed. Both routes that can flip it call in here — `PATCH /api/users/:id` and
 * `DELETE /api/users/:id`.
 *
 * Removal is ONE-WAY by design (issue 02): re-activating a user restores their login, not their
 * place on tasks somebody else has since been made responsible for.
 *
 * ── The rule lives in TWO places, and they are kept identical ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `applyTaskPeopleRule` below and the SQL in
 * `prisma/migrations/20260825120000_task_people_arrays_drop_inactive/migration.sql` decide the
 * same thing: keep only the ids that name an ACTIVE user of the task's OWN organization, and if
 * that empties `assignee_ids`, hand the task to its still-active creator, else to the org's
 * longest-serving active ADMIN, else leave the array alone and count it as stranded.
 *
 * What differs between them is the SCOPE, not the rule:
 *
 *   * this module looks only at the tasks that name the user being deactivated, in that user's
 *     org, because that is the transition it reacts to. The migration looks at every task in
 *     every org, because it is repairing everything that accumulated before this existed.
 *   * the migration writes no timeline entries and sends no notifications. A backfill has no
 *     actor to attribute them to.
 *   * `toIdSet` here de-duplicates; the SQL's `ARRAY(SELECT ... unnest)` does not. An
 *     `assignee_ids` of `{a,a}` with `a` still active comes back `[a]` from this module and
 *     `{a,a}` from the migration. Left as is on purpose: both satisfy the ">= 1 assignee"
 *     invariant, no writer produces a duplicate in the first place, and the DISTINCT that would
 *     close it would also throw away the array's order.
 *
 * Anything else that comes apart is a defect in one of the two. `task-people-rule.test.ts` pins
 * the rule case by case and re-reads the migration's load-bearing predicates.

 *              escalates to the org's LONGEST-SERVING active ADMIN: `role = 'ADMIN'`,

 *     for them: those tasks no longer name the departing user, so a second sweep never sees them.

 *   * NOT recovered at all: a crash between a chunk's COMMIT and the announcement. Those new
 *     owners are never told they own the work. The task is in their list either way, which is why
