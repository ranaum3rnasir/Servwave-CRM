/**
 * Entity-redesign §3 / §10 — shared service-location resolution + tax-warning.
 *
 * `resolveOrAccreteLocation` anchors a Lead (Phase 4a) / Job (Phase 4c) to exactly
 * one of the customer's `ServiceLocation`s:
 *   - an explicit `service_location_id` is validated against the customer (and org)
 *     and returned unchanged;
 *   - otherwise an `address` is normalized and find-or-created on the customer
 *     (dedupe on normalized `address_line1` + `zip`).
 *
 * NORMALIZATION (lowercase/trim line1 + strip non-digits of zip) is the SINGLE
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH that Phase D's location-backfill SQL must mirror so the two
 * never diverge (plan §4a, line 227 / §12 D2 line 377).
 *
 * `buildLocationTaxWarning` produces the informational tax-warning signal surfaced
 * when a location change crosses a state line (destination-based tax, §11).
