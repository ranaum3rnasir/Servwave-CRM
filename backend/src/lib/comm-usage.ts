 *
 * Deliberately DERIVED, not metered. There is no balance table and no debit
 * hook: usage is aggregated on read from the CallSession and Message rows the
 * comm module already writes. That means the meter is retroactively correct
 * the moment it ships (existing history counts), a replayed CTM webhook cannot
 * double-count, and there is no counter that can drift away from the rows it
 * claims to summarise. Enforcement, when it lands, reads this same function.
 *
 * Both directions count. CTM bills the org for inbound tracking-number minutes
 * as well as outbound, so a meter that only watched outbound would under-report
 * the thing it exists to cap.
