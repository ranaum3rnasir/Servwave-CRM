/**
 * receiving-numbers.test.ts - resolve a CTM `receiving_number_id` to a phone.
 *
 * A forwarded inbound call arrives with NO agent object; the only identity in
 * the payload is `receiving_number_id`, which is CTM's numeric `filter_id`
 * (NOT the RPN string id). Confirmed against the live Alpha Doors sub-account
 * on 2026-08-07: filter_id 3902576 is the number ending 5160, and the
 * receiving_numbers list endpoint carries `filter_id` on every record.
 *
 * Two hard constraints shape this module, and both are asserted below:
 *
 *  1. LOOKUP NEVER FETCHES. ingestCall runs inside the webhook's
 *     prisma.$transaction, so an HTTP call on that path would hold a database
 *     transaction open across the network - the 5s interactive-transaction
 *     timeout would abort the whole ingest and lose the call row entirely.
 *     Callers warm the cache BEFORE the transaction; the in-transaction read
 *     is a pure cache hit or nothing.
 *
 *  2. WARMING FAILS OPEN. Attribution is a nice-to-have on top of a call
 *     record. A CTM outage, a revoked key or an unconfigured environment must
 *     degrade the answer to "unknown", never reject the webhook - CTM would
 *     retry a 500 and we would drop calls to gain a name.
