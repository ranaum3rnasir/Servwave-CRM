/**
 * Clobber-safe composition of a disjunctive (OR) filter group into a Prisma `where`.
 *
 * Why this exists: list controllers spread the grant-driven row-scope fragment from
 * `scopeWhereForReq` into their `where`. For a MULTI-READ user (≥2 distinct conditional
 * read grants — e.g. a tech whose role read is `OWN_WALKTHROUGH` AND whose per-user
 * `update Lead` override implies an `OWN_LEAD` read; or a SALES user whose role read is
 * `OWN_INVOICE_VIA_LEAD` AND whose `create Invoice` override implies `OWN_INVOICE_VIA_JOB`)
 * that fragment is `{ OR: [...] }`. If the same handler then assigns its own search OR with
 * `where.OR = [...]`, the two `OR` keys collide and the scope `OR` is SILENTLY DROPPED —
 * a row-scope LEAK. Use this helper instead of `where.OR = clauses`.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *   - No `OR` present  → set `where.OR = clauses` (unchanged cheap shape).
 *   - An `OR` already present (the spread-in scope) → demote BOTH disjunctions under `AND`
 *     as peers (`AND: [..., { OR: <existing> }, { OR: clauses }]`) so each remains REQUIRED.
 *     This is the anti-leak invariant: the scope OR is never lost, and the search OR is ANDed
 *     on top (a search narrows the already-scoped set — the correct precedence).
 *   - An existing `AND` is appended to, never replaced.
 *
 * Safe to call unconditionally (it does the right thing whether or not a scope OR is present),
 * so callers don't have to know whether the requester is a multi-read user.
