// ⚠️  LogisticOrder — READ THIS BEFORE WRITING ANY LogisticOrder CONTROLLER (LO-2 and later)
//
//     canAccessRow(req, 'LogisticOrder', …) IS NOT A TENANCY GATE. It can return true for an id
//     belonging to ANOTHER ORGANIZATION.
//
// Why: every non-ADMIN role that reaches LOs holds an UNCONDITIONAL `read LogisticOrder`
// (SALES and DISPATCHER, per defaultGrants.ts — LO row scope is org-wide in v1). An
// unconditional read makes `scopeWhereFor` return {} (line ~49). canAccessRow then hits its
// "empty fragment ⇒ no restriction" fast path (enforce.ts ~172-173) and returns true WITHOUT
// EVER RUNNING the tenant-scoped findFirst on the next line. ADMIN short-circuits even earlier.
// So for LogisticOrder there is currently no caller for whom that probe executes at all.
//
// This differs from Estimate/Invoice, where SALES holds a CONDITIONAL read — the findFirst does
// run there, and its `...tenantWhere(req)` incidentally blocks a cross-org id. LogisticOrder
// gets no such incidental protection. Do not copy the Invoice controller's pattern and assume
// you inherit it.
//
// THEREFORE, in every LogisticOrder controller, spread `tenantWhere(req)` into YOUR OWN where
// clause on every read AND every write — findFirst/findMany/update/updateMany/delete alike:
//
//     const lo = await prisma.logisticOrder.findFirst({ where: { id, ...tenantWhere(req) } });
//     if (!lo) { res.status(404)…; return; }
//     await prisma.logisticOrder.update({ where: { id: lo.id }, data: … });
//
// The anti-pattern to avoid — `canAccessRow` followed by a bare-id write — passes a cross-org
// UUID straight through:
//
//     if (!(await canAccessRow(req, 'LogisticOrder', prisma.logisticOrder, id))) { …403… }
//     await prisma.logisticOrder.update({ where: { id }, data: … });   // ← CROSS-ORG WRITE
//
// Nothing in LO-1 is exploitable (no LO routes exist yet); this is a precedent hazard for the
// controllers LO-2+ will add. Fixing enforce.ts instead is deliberately out of scope — that
// helper is shared by every subject and changing its fast path is its own reviewed change.

/**
 * The Prisma `where` fragment for a user's row-scope on a resource, derived by UNIONing ALL
 * `read` grants for the resource (role grants PLUS the own-scoped reads synthesized from a user's
 * per-user ALLOW overrides — appended by `scopeWhereForReq`) so the SQL scope agrees with the CASL
 * ability (which materializes the same paired own-scoped read for an allow override). Pure — grants
 * are injected. Resolved through substituteConditions.
 *   ADMIN / ANY unconditional read → {} (no restriction)
 *   no read grant                  → MATCH_NOTHING
 *   one conditional read           → that substituted condition
 *   multiple conditional reads     → { OR: [...] } of each substituted condition
 * FAIL-CLOSED: a Team/Location condition whose token resolves to null contributes MATCH_NOTHING
 * (never the fail-open `*_id: null` match) — i.e. that one grant is dropped from the union; if it
 * was the only read, the result is MATCH_NOTHING.
 *
 * `action` defaults to 'read' - the visibility question, and the only thing this answered before
 * the technician-ownership spec (Part C). Pass another action to get the AUTHORITY fragment for
 * that verb instead: once a role holds `delete Job` under a NARROWER condition than its `read Job`
 * (TECHNICIAN's creator-scoped delete vs its assigned-or-created read), a read-derived fragment
 * says yes to rows the delete grant refuses. `canActOnRow` is the intended caller - it intersects
 * the two rather than substituting one for the other.
