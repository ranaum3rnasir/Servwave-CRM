/**
 * Canonical per-instance ownership check for update/delete controllers (#106b).
 *
 * Enforces visibility through SQL — the SAME `scopeWhereForReq` fragment that
 * powers the (now-correct) lists — instead of CASL's in-memory matcher. This is
 * the uniform fix for the two Wave 2 holes:
 *   - P0: invoice update/delete used `canAccessInvoice()`, which hardcoded
 *     `role===ADMIN||DISPATCHER → true` and IGNORED the persisted grant condition.
 *   - P1: `req.ability.can()` THROWS "equals does not supports comparison of
 *     arrays and objects" on NESTED to-one→to-many conditions (Estimate via
 *     `lead.lead_assignees`; Job/Lead Team via `assignees.some.user.department_id`).
 * A `where`-fragment compiles to SQL, so it is nested-safe and grant-driven.
 *
 * Usage in a controller (keeps the SAME early-return 403 the lifecycle verbs use):
 *
 *   if (!(await canAccessRow(req, 'Invoice', prisma.invoice, id))) {
 *     res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' });
 *     return;
 *   }
 *
 * Returns whether `id` is visible under the user's per-subject scope:
 *   ADMIN / unconditional read → scope is {} → visible (fast-path, no query)
 *   conditional read grant     → owner/team/location condition must match the row
 *   no read grant / no user    → MATCH_NOTHING (`id: { in: [] }`) → never matches → false
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS NOT A TENANCY CHECK. On the unconditional-read fast-path it returns `true` WITHOUT
 * QUERYING AT ALL, so `tenantWhere` is never applied and a row id belonging to ANOTHER
 * ORGANIZATION passes. The `tenantWhere(req)` on the second branch is incidental — it only ever
 * runs when the subject happens to carry a conditional read grant.
 *
 * That fast-path is the DEFAULT for LogisticOrder today: every role that reads LOs holds a
 * condition-less `read LogisticOrder` (defaultGrants.ts), so `canAccessRow(req, 'LogisticOrder',
 * …)` short-circuits to `true` for SALES and DISPATCHER as well as ADMIN. It is equally reachable
 * for any other subject whose read grant is unconditional.
 *
 * So a controller MUST spread `tenantWhere(req)` into its OWN `where` — canAccessRow does not
 * substitute for it and never has:
 *
 *   if (!(await canAccessRow(req, 'LogisticOrder', prisma.logisticOrder, id))) { … 403 … }
 *   const row = await prisma.logisticOrder.findFirst({ where: { id, ...tenantWhere(req) } });
