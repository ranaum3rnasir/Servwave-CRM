 * Deliver an owner's sales/support message to the ServWave inbox.
 *
 * Platform voice: this is a contractor writing TO us, so the From must not be
 * stamped with the org's display name as if the org were the sender. The org is
 * identified in the body instead, and `replyTo` carries the person who wrote it,
 * so hitting reply in the inbox answers the human rather than the mailer.
 *
 * The body's identity block is read HERE, from the org row, rather than taken
 * from the request - the sender names only their message, subject, reply-to and
 * topic. See sales-request-email.ts for what it renders.
 *
 * Returns the raw dispatch result. Unlike most senders here this one does NOT
 * swallow its failure - the composer told the owner their message was sent, so
 * the caller has to be able to tell them the truth when it was not.
