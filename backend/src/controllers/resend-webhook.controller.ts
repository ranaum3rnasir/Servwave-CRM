 *      resolves recipients itself and returns them, so the thread's owner is
 *      decided in ONE place (resolveRecipients) rather than re-derived here.
 *   2. `publishEmailsChanged` nudges the open Inbox to refetch its message
 *      list. Separate from `notifications.changed` so the Inbox does not
 *      refetch every message on every unrelated notification.
 *
 * Only the same people get both: a signal is a "refetch now" with no content,
 * and the refetch goes back through the API where `commVisibilityWhere` still
 * applies, so this can never leak a message the recipient could not read.
 *
 * Dedup-keyed on the provider message id: Resend retries webhooks for hours,
 * and a redelivery that slips past the event ledger must not ring the bell
 * twice for one reply.

 *
 * PRECEDENT: modeled on ctm-webhook.controller.ts (claim-first idempotency via
 * a dedicated ledger table, tolerant "unknown correlation -> record + 200"
 * handling), NOT on webhook.controller.ts's Stripe handler, which skips
 * signature verification when NODE_ENV==='test' - that would ship zero real

 * AUTH — fail CLOSED, single gate (resend@6's own svix-based verification):
 *  1. RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET unset -> 401 for EVERY request (Phase-0 posture
 *     shared with CTM_WEBHOOK_TOKEN/CTM_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET).
 *  2. Any of the three svix-* headers missing -> 401.
 *  3. resend.webhooks.verify() throws (bad signature) -> 401.
 *
 * `resendWebhooks` exists ONLY to reach `.webhooks.verify()`, which is pure
 * local HMAC/svix verification - no network call, no API key touched at
 * runtime - so it is safe to construct even when RESEND_API_KEY is unset. This
