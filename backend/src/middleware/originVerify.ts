//     DIRECTLY; it never traverses Cloudflare, so it must stay reachable or
//     Render will mark the service unhealthy and recycle it.
// Matching is exact-or-subpath so a lookalike like "/api/webhooks-fake" is NOT
// accidentally exempted.

/**
 * Rejects traffic that did not arrive via Cloudflare.

 * Cloudflare attaches a secret X-Origin-Verify header on every forwarded
 * request; a request that hits the Render origin directly (bypassing Cloudflare)
 * won't have it and is answered with 403. Webhook and health-check paths are
 * exempt (see EXEMPT_PREFIXES).
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN by design: if ORIGIN_VERIFY_SECRET is not configured, the check is
 * skipped (with a loud warning) rather than 403-ing all traffic. This is a
 * deliberate safety valve so a missing or mistyped env var can't lock the entire
 * API out. The trade-off is that origin verification is INACTIVE until the secret
 * is set — which is why the warning exists.
