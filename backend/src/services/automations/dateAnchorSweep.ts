/**
 * dateAnchorSweep.ts — candidate selection for the unified date-anchored trigger
 * family.
 *
 * A date-anchored workflow fires at `anchorDate ∓ offset`. Rather than parking an
 * enrollment ahead of time, the poller sweeps each anchor's date field every
 * minute for rows whose fire moment has just arrived and enrolls them then. Two
 * consequences worth knowing:
 *
 *  - No re-arm. Nothing is parked before the fire moment, so a rescheduled job or
 *    an edited due date is simply picked up at its new time on a later tick. The
 *    occurrence key is the anchor date itself, so a moved date is a genuinely new
 *    occurrence (new dedupe key → a fresh reminder) while the old date's key can
 *    never fire twice.
 *  - The product rule falls out of the window. For `before`, the window is
 *    [now, now+offset]: an anchor still upcoming but inside the lead time is in
 *    range and fires immediately (late but useful); an anchor already past is
 *    below `now` and can never enter the window (no stale reminder).
 *
 * PURE query layer — selects rows, never enrolls. cron.ts owns enrollment.
