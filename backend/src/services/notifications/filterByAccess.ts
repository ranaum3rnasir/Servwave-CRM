// LOGISTIC_ORDER is deliberately ABSENT: its notifications (lo.submitted →
// approve-grant holders ∪ ADMINs; lo.approved → the creator) go only to org-wide
// LO readers, so they must NOT be row-scope-filtered — an absent key means the
// passthrough below keeps every resolved recipient. REVISIT this if a row-scoped
// reader (e.g. a technician) is ever added as an LO recipient: add
// `LOGISTIC_ORDER: 'LogisticOrder'` here (the delegateMap entry already exists)
// so those recipients get access-checked.
//
// TASK is deliberately ABSENT for a different reason, and a permanent one (multi-assignee
// design §5). A task has no CASL row scope to check against: `taskVisibilityWhere` grants
// access precisely BY naming someone in `assignee_ids` / `watcher_ids`, so every recipient
// resolveRecipients can produce for a task verb is, by construction, already someone who
// can see the row. Adding `TASK: 'Task'` here would not tighten anything — there is no
// `Task` ScopeResource — it would only re-derive a fact the recipient list already encodes.
