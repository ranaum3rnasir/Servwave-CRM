/**
 * Multi-visit S4 (D7): the one place the job page drives a visit's lifecycle.
 *
 * The routed v2 Visits card calls THIS hook rather than posting its own URLs, so the button-to-
 * route mapping and the invalidation set stay in one place. There was a second, unrouted v1 card
 * that also called it; it was deleted once the v1 job page went, so the anti-drift rule #1551 was
 * spent establishing no longer has a twin to police here - keep new callers on this hook.
 *
 * The invalidation set is the fix B16 needs, and it is deliberately explicit rather than inherited
 * from the page's `invalidateJob`: that helper never invalidated the visits query, so a card whose
 * button had just changed a visit went on rendering the pre-click status. `['job', id]` and
 * `['jobs']` ride along because Job.status and its schedule mirror are recomputed server-side in
 * the same transaction as the visit write (D12), so the job payload really is stale too.
