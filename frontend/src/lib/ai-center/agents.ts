// AI Center catalog data.
//
// Source of truth: the ServWave AI Agents board (30-agent / 10-category model). The
// agents are branded as animals: each `name` is the agent's animal and its avatar is
// a flat geometric animal icon under /public/ai-center/agents/{id}.png, with
// `avatarColor` kept as a colored-initial fallback. The 2026-06-23 board refresh
// renamed three agents (Wolf→Salmon, Eagle→Hawk, and the reconciliation Octopus→Crab)
// and added Phoenix, the AI Marketing Director. The 2026-07-15 refresh replaced the
// broken "Tortoise Hawk" duplicate with Goose (AI Compliance Watcher, same HR slot)
// and added Spider (AI Lead Manager, new Sales Intelligence category) and the Master
// Agent (AI Center Orchestrator, its own category) — all 30 now ship an icon. The `id`
// of each pre-existing agent stays its original human first name (it keys the icon
// file path); the 3 newest agents use clean animal-name ids. Taglines / long
// descriptions use the animal name. v1 is discovery + "book a call" only — no
// pricing, no live agent functionality (mirrors the Tasks/Reports frontend ports).
