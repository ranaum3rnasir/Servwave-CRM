/**
 * Invoice list statuses, in `InvoiceStatus` enum order. Single source of
 * truth for the Status facet's static VALUE list - was previously duplicated
 * inline in `InvoicesPage.tsx` as `INVOICE_STATUSES`/`STATUS_LABELS`; moved
 * here so the registry and any other Invoices-page consumer share one
 * definition (mirrors how Task 13 moved `ESTIMATE_STATUSES`/
 * `ESTIMATE_STATUS_LABELS` out of `EstimatesPage.tsx`).
 *
 * The companion `INVOICE_STATUS_LABELS` map is GONE: labels now resolve
 * through `STATUS_REGISTRY.invoice`, the app-wide single source of truth for
 * what an invoice status is called and how it looks. All seven pre-existing
 * labels were byte-identical to the registry's, so no label changed.
 *
 * `DISPUTED` was MISSING from this list - it is a real `InvoiceStatus` enum
 * member (backend/prisma/schema.prisma) that the list endpoint already
 * accepts (`invoice.filters.ts`'s `status` facet validates against
 * `Object.values(InvoiceStatus)`), so a disputed invoice was simply
 * unfilterable from the UI. Added here in enum order. This is a functional
 * add, not part of the registry refactor.
 *
 * `OVERDUE` is deliberately NOT here even though the registry carries it:
 * it is client-derived from `due_date` + status, not a backend enum value,
 * and it already has its own dedicated `overdue` facet below.

/**
 * Invoices list facet registry (Task 15, plus a Task-15-follow-up `overdue`
 * facet). One `FacetConfig` per Task 14 backend facet
 * (`backend/src/lib/query/registries/invoice.filters.ts`): `status`, `total`
 * (range), `balance` (range), `created` (dateRange), `due` (dateRange) — plus
 * `overdue`, a 1-option `multi` facet wired to the pre-existing
 * `?overdue=true` computed-predicate param (see below).
 *
 * `total`/`balance` are brand-new UI — the live pre-Task-15 page had NO Total
 * or Balance range filter at all (confirmed in Task 14's report, which
 * corrected the original brief's claim that one already existed). Both are
 * `money: true` range facets with static `maxSource` ceilings (see below),
 * the second production page (after Estimates' `total`) with a money range,
 * and the FIRST page with two coexisting money ranges — `FilterBar` renders
 * only the selected rail tab's control at a time, so Total and Balance never
 * render simultaneously and can't clash; each dispatches through its own
 * `facet.key`/`param` independently (`total_min`/`total_max` vs
 * `balance_min`/`balance_max`), confirmed via `RangeFacet`'s `aria-label`s
 * (`"Total From"`/`"Total To"` vs `"Balance Due From"`/`"Balance Due To"`).
 *
 * `overdue` is modeled as a 1-option `multi` facet (`options: [{value:'true',
 * label:'Overdue'}]`) rather than a standalone boolean toggle — same pattern
 * `tax_exempt` uses on the Customers registry. Checking it sets
 * `values: ['true']`, which the URL codec encodes as `?overdue=true` — the
 * exact string `buildInvoiceListWhere` (`invoice.controller.ts`) already
 * reads via `req.query.overdue === 'true'`, so no backend change was needed.
 * The backend still runs its `overdue` handling AFTER `applyFilters` (MERGING
 * `{ lt: now }` onto whatever the `due` facet set on `due_date`, and
 * OVERWRITING `status` to `{in:['SENT','PARTIAL']}`) — that composition is
 * unchanged; only the frontend's origin of the `?overdue=true` param moved
 * from a bespoke checkbox into this facet.
 *
 * `customer_id` was a standalone async Customer search (`CustomerSelect`) —
 * removed from the page entirely (not ported as a facet): customer names are
 * specific enough that the page's existing global search bar already covers
 * this use case with no loss of value.
 *
 * The old page's "Active" quick-toggle inside the Status filter section
 *   (a curated `['DRAFT','SENT','PARTIAL']` preset chip, reused by the
 *   Due/Unsent KPI math) is DROPPED, not ported — `CheckboxFacet`'s
 *   Select-all only covers the visible/search-filtered option set, it can't
 *   express an arbitrary curated subset as a one-click preset. Same
 *   precedent as Leads'/Jobs' dropped "Active" toggle. Users can still
 *   select DRAFT+SENT+PARTIAL manually via the Status pane; the Due/Unsent
 *   KPI tiles (which used to double as this preset) are unaffected — they
 *   set the same two/one-status combination directly via `setValue`, not
 *   through this dropped chip.
 *
 * Exported as a module-level `const` (not a function or inline literal) per
 * `useFilterState.ts`'s reference-stability requirement.
