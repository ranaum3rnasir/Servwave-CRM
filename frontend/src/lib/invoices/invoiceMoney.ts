/**
 * Invoice money, ledger and action derivations - ONE implementation.
 *
 * These are the functions that decide what an invoice has collected, refunded,
 * credited and overpaid, and which actions a viewer may take on it. They were
 * authored inside `pages/InvoiceDetailPage.tsx`; two of them were exported and
 * the other five were not, so the /v2 invoice pages imported what they could
 * and copied the rest. Two copies of money arithmetic is exactly the failure
 * this module exists to prevent, so all of it now lives here and both
 * presentations import it.
 *
 * The row types travel with the functions: `buildLedgerEvents` takes an
 * `InvoiceDetail`, and a hand-written second copy of that shape would drift the
 * moment a field is added.
