// How an outbound message's delivery state reads in the UI.
//
// The backend stopped writing `sent` optimistically (see lib/ctm/sendSms.ts):
// a row is `queued` until the provider accepts it, `sent` once it does,
// `delivered` once the carrier confirms via the status_change webhook, and
// `skipped` when a gate deliberately suppressed the send. Rendering all of
// those as an ordinary blue bubble would put the false-success back in the UI
// even though the data is now honest.
