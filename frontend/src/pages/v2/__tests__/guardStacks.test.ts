/**
 * Every route carries the guard stack it is supposed to carry.
 *
 * WHO MAY OPEN A PAGE is the one property of this migration that nothing else
 * checks and that fails silently when it breaks. Drop a `RequireFeature` and an
 * org that does not own the module reaches the page; widen an `allowedRoles` and
 * a technician reaches the standalone invoice form; lose `fallback` and a SALES
 * user is bounced to "/" instead of getting the in-place "no access" screen. In
 * every one of those the page still renders, so nothing looks broken from the
 * branch that did it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS FILE USED TO ASSERT SOMETHING ELSE, AND WHY IT NO LONGER CAN.
 *
 * It was `guardParity.test.ts`, and its premise was that every `/v2/x` route had
 * a legacy twin at `x` in App.tsx and had to carry that twin's stack, guard for
 * guard. That premise is gone: these routes now own the bare paths, and App.tsx
 * declares no page route at all, so there is no second table left to diff
 * against. The check could not be kept - but it must not be dropped either,
 * because the property it protected is unchanged, and it is the property a
 * restyle is most likely to break by accident.
 *
 * So the twin table was replaced by the PIN below, seeded from that very table.
 * At the commit that un-prefixed the routes, the old assertion was re-run once
 * against `App.tsx@b1b7223cb` - the last revision that still held the legacy
 * route table - across all 73 routes. It reported 71 legacy routes, ZERO guard
 * mismatches, and ZERO legacy paths that stopped being routed; the only two
 * routes without a twin were the two that never had one (`/_kit-reference` and
 * `/not-authorized`). Every line of the pin is therefore the guard stack the
 * legacy route table carried, mechanically transcribed rather than retyped.
 *
 * WHEN THIS FILE FAILS, THE FIX IS ALMOST NEVER TO EDIT THE PIN. A changed stack
 * means the change either altered who can reach a page - in which case that is
 * the thing to review, and the pin moves in the same commit, deliberately - or
 * it did not, in which case the route file is wrong. Regenerating the pin to
 * match whatever the routes now say turns this file into a mirror, and a mirror
 * catches nothing.
 */

/**
 * Path -> the guards wrapping it, outermost first.
 *
 * `ProtectedRoute(roles=…, fallback=…)` normalises the two axes that decide
 * access; layouts are excluded, since chrome is not a permission. See
 * `routeTable.ts`.
 *
 * The outer `ProtectedRoute(roles=ADMIN|DISPATCHER|SALES|TECHNICIAN)` on most
 * entries rejects nobody on its own - its list is every role there is - but it
 * is the app-wide authenticated gate, and its ABSENCE would mean an unauthed
 * user reaching the page, so it is part of the stack.
