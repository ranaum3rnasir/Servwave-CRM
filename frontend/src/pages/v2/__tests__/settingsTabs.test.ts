/**
 * Every settings tab is BOTH routed and reachable by clicking.
 *
 * Settings is the one module where the two can come apart. Its pages are not
 * linked from anywhere else in the app - no row click, no breadcrumb, no command
 * palette entry reaches `/settings/tax-rates` - so a page whose route exists
 * while its nav row does not is a page only someone who already knows the URL
 * can open. That is indistinguishable from having deleted it.
 *
 * It very nearly happened. Four tabs - Lead Statuses, Tax Rates, Sender Address
 * and Custom Fields - were never rebuilt on the kit, so the rebuilt shell's NAV
 * listed twelve entries where the original listed sixteen. When the rebuilt
 * `/settings` took over the bare path, those routes had to move under it
 * (`routes/settings.routes.tsx`) and their nav rows had to be added to the
 * shell, or the move would have quietly cost four working admin pages. This test
 * is what makes that a failure rather than a discovery.
 *
 * Three of the four are asserted below. Custom Fields is the exception: it is
 * held out of the 2026-08-17 release entirely - no route, no nav row, no claimed
 * path - because the feature has never been exercised by a human in a real org.
 * That is a deliberate absence, so the case below asserts it stays absent rather
 * than leaving a gap a future edit could fill by accident.
 *
 * Source-parsed for the reason `routeTable.ts` explains: NAV is a module-private
 * array, and rendering the shell to read it needs an ability, an entitlements
 * cache and an org. The array is a static literal, so its text is its value.
