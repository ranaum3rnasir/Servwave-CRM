/**
 * A KPI tile shows its TITLE and its NUMBER, and nothing else.
 *
 * StatCard grew two secondary slots - a `delta` chip beside the value and a
 * `meta` caption under it - and every KPI row in the v2 layer filled at least
 * one of them. Most of what they carried was not a trend at all: "All time",
 * "This week", "Completed, unbilled", "materials tracked" are captions wearing
 * a chip, and the few real ones ("-54%", "+4pp vs last mo") are the case the
 * owner ruled on directly. Both slots are out, at the component and at every
 * call site.
 *
 * Asserted on the tile's whole textContent rather than on the absence of a
 * particular element, because that is the only form that catches a caption
 * moved into some other wrapper instead of removed.
