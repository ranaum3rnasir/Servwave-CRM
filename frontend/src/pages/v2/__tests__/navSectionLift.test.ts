/**
 * The v2 sidebar renders a nav group (Inventory, Communication) as a
 * disclosure: the parent row toggles, and its children hang off it. Those
 * children have to carry the parent's entitlement, and once they did not:
 * `NavChild` has no `feature` of its own, so every child read as unlocked
 * whatever the org owned. On a Starter org it put six clickable rows in the
 * sidebar - Purchase Orders, Vendors, Assets, WhatsApp, Email, Text -
 * underneath two greyed-out locked parents. The route gate still held, so each
 * bounced to /upgrade on click, but the sidebar was advertising modules the org
 * does not own, and nav-registry.ts records the same defect being fixed once
 * already for the Price Book row.
 *
 * The children used to be LIFTED to flat siblings here, because the kit's nav
 * had no disclosure control; they are nested under the parent now that it does.
 * The rule these tests pin is unchanged and is the one that broke twice - a
 * locked parent produces no children, and an unlocked one hands each child its
 * gating - so they still assert it, over `item.children` rather than over the
 * flat list.
 *
 * These run against the REAL registry and the REAL section map, so the Starter
 * case below is the exact scenario from the bug report rather than a
 * re-statement of it in fixtures. Only the two org-shaped inputs are injected:
 * what the user may do (`can`) and what the org owns (`isLocked`).

 *
 * `feature` became `string | string[]` when Communication was re-declared as
