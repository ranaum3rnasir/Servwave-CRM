 * that card's rect is fully outside the viewport - calls the NATIVE
 * `scrollIntoView({ block: 'center', inline: 'center' })` on it.
 *
 * That call takes no container and cannot be scoped. It walks EVERY scroll
 * container between the card and the document and centres the card in each one.
 * An `overflow: hidden` box IS a scroll container - it simply has no scrollbar -
 * so the app frame and the page's own scroller are moved along with the lane.
 * What the user sees is the shell scrolled off its own origin: the sidebar
 * clipped past the left edge, the top bar above the top one, and nothing that
 * puts either back.
 *
 * The card's rect really is outside the viewport for the drop this fixes.
 * Dragging out past the last lane auto-scrolls the track - the one thing
 * `canScroll` below permits - and once the track has travelled far enough, the
 * lane the card started in has left the screen on the left. That is dnd-kit's
 * own test for "needs revealing": `right <= 0`.
 *
 * So the node answers the call itself and scrolls nothing. Nothing needs
 * revealing: the card is where the user just left it. The KeyboardSensor reveals
 * a card the same way when it is lifted, and that one is redundant too - the
 * browser has already scrolled the card into view in order to focus it.
 *
 * An OWN property, so it shadows `Element.prototype` for this node alone and
 * every other element on the page keeps the real method.

 * "Emergency callout" glyph. The column, which is where the board's chrome
 * actually lives, composes cleanly. Both are recorded in the gap ledger.
 *
 * The At Risk lane is an EXCLUSIVE partition: an unfinished task whose
 * `assessRisk(...).atRisk` is true appears there and is absent from its status
 * column. It is also not a drop target - a drop that resolves to it is a no-op,
 * exactly as the legacy lane (which carried no drop handler) behaved.
