/**
 * /v2/tasks - the Tasks hub on the CRM UI kit.
 *
 * Three facts about state that the rebuild had to preserve exactly:
 *
 *  1. The ACTIVE TAB is component-local `useState`, not the URL, not a store,
 *     not localStorage. It resets to `my-day` on every remount and reload, and
 *     there is no `?tab=` param. Lifting it to the URL would change the Back
 *     button, deep links and reload behaviour, so it stays local.
 *  2. The task list lives in a ZUSTAND store, not TanStack Query. There are no
 *     query keys to invalidate anywhere in this module and every mutation
 *     writes the server row back by hand. `fetchTasks()` early-returns when
 *     `loading || loaded`, so it hydrates once per page-load lifetime.
 *  3. Filter state (`taskFilterStore`) and drawer state (`taskDetailStore`) are
 *     module-level, so both survive a tab switch.
 *
 * TAB ORDER opens on the work rather than on the reporting: My Day first and as
 * the landing tab for every role, then the ways of looking at the same list
 * (Board, List, Calendar), then History. DASHBOARD IS LAST and MANAGER-ONLY -
 * its KPIs aggregate the whole org, which is not a technician's or a sales
 * rep's view of their own day. HISTORY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE: it shows the
 * viewer's own completed tasks, so there is nothing there to gate on.
 *
 * The one permission conditional in the whole Tasks UI is `isManager`, a raw
 * role-string check and NOT CASL (carried over from the History gate it
 * replaces), and it gates the Dashboard trigger AND its panel. Gating the panel
 * as well as the trigger is what makes it impossible for a non-manager to land
 * on `'dashboard'`: the initial tab is `'my-day'` for everyone, nothing sets
 * `'dashboard'` except its own trigger, and `DashboardView`'s KPI drill-down
 * only ever sets `'list'`.
 *
 * Panels are unmounted when inactive (TabPanel returns null), which matches the
 * legacy Radix `TabsContent` default - no `forceMount` was ever passed - so a
 * view's local state (the calendar's anchor, My Day's plan nonce) resets on a
 * tab switch here too.

  // THE ROW IS RESOLVED BEFORE THE DRAWER IS OPENED. `TaskDetailDrawer` renders
  // `Sheet open={!!task}` off `tasks.find(openTaskId)` and re-fetches on every id
  // change, and `fetchTaskDetail` APPENDS a row the store has never seen - so a
  // cold arrival (clicked from another page, or a pasted URL, with the list fetch
  // still in flight) would eventually resolve either way. Doing it HERE buys the
  // two things the drawer cannot:
  //   - the dead end. `fetchTaskDetail` neither catches nor reports, so a 404 on
  //     a `task.deleted` row raised inside the drawer's effect is an UNHANDLED
  //     REJECTION that leaves `openTaskId` pinned to a task that will never
  //     arrive and tells the user nothing. Rejection here is the one place it can
  //     be caught, and `openTaskId` is never set for a row that is gone.
  //   - no closed-sheet frame: the store already holds the task when the id
  //     flips, so the drawer paints filled on its first render.
  // The drawer's own effect then re-fetches the same id. That is a refresh of an
  // already-rendered row, not what makes it appear.
  //
  // No cleanup function and a ref guard rather than a `cancelled` closure: the
  // strip below re-runs this effect with a new `searchParams`, and a cleanup
  // would cancel the in-flight open before it ever happened. The ref also makes
  // StrictMode's double-invoke a no-op on the second pass.
