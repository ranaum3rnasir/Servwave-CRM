/**
 * Module 11 - Settings & Users. Every path this module claims.
 *
 * `/settings` itself is listed as well as each child: the route mounts the
 * layout with an index redirect to `company`, so the bare path is a real
 * destination and not just a prefix.
 *
 * `/settings/organization` is deliberately ABSENT. The map for this module lists
 * it, but `OrganizationSettingsPage.tsx` has been deleted and no route declares
 * it - registering a path with no route would make the registry describe a page
 * that does not exist.
