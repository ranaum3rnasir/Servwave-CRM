/**
 * The v2 sidebar's row list: resolve the user's pinned keys to destinations,
 * CASL-filter them, attach a group's children to it, bucket the result by
 * section.
 *
 * A PURE FUNCTION, deliberately, and separate from `V2AppLayout` even though it
 * has exactly one caller. The child rule it holds is the one that has already
 * shipped wrong twice - a group's child carried no entitlement, so on a Starter
 * org six locked modules rendered as live sidebar rows under two greyed-out
 * parents - and that is worth a test. Reaching it through the layout means
 * standing up an auth store, an ability, an entitlements cache, an org, the
 * copilot, the softphone warmup and the settings guard before the rule under
 * test runs at all. Here it is four arguments and a return value.
 *
 * The layout keeps everything that needs React: the lock LABEL (which plan
 * badge to show), the active-row test, the open/closed state of a group, and
 * the href rewriting.
