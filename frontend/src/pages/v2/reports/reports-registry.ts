 * slug -> the v2 report page component.
 *
 * The same 23 slugs as `pages/reports/reports-registry.ts`, pointed at this
 * module's rebuilds. Deliberately a SECOND registry rather than an import of
 * the legacy one: a registry maps a slug to a COMPONENT, and reusing the legacy
 * map would render legacy pages inside the v2 shell - the one thing this
 * migration exists not to do. The slug set is the contract between the two and
 * is asserted by `__tests__/reportsRegistry.test.ts`, so a report added to one
 * and forgotten in the other fails the build rather than silently falling
 * through to the generic report.
