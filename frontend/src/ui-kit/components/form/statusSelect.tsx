/**
 * Status picker: a dot and a label per option, a check on the current one.
 *
 * THIS USED TO RENDER THE BADGE ITSELF in every row, on the reasoning that a
 * chip in the control and a chip in the table speak one visual language and
 * spare the reader a legend. That argument holds for the TRIGGER, where one
 * chip sits alone, and breaks down in the LIST: six saturated solid pills
 * stacked in a panel are six things shouting at once, none of them the one you
 * have selected, and a chip earns its colour by being the only one in view.
 * The lead detail page shipped that version and it was the first thing called
 * out in review.
 *
 * So the trigger keeps the chip - one status, in the language the table uses -
 * and the list drops to a dot plus a label, which carries the same tone at a
 * weight that lets six sit together. The CURRENT value is marked by a check,
 * which is what a picker is supposed to do and what a list of chips never did.
 *
 * `pages/v2/_shared/statusMenu.tsx` is the same design on a DropdownMenu, for
 * detail-page headers where the control is an action rather than a form field.
 * Keep the two looking alike.
 *
 * Reserve the solid treatment for status, the field that defines a record.
 * Priority, category and similar qualifiers should use the soft Badge variants
 * so half a dozen pickers on one form don't shout over each other.
