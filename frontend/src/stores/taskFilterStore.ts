/**
 * A filter chosen by one account must not follow the next one into the same tab.
 *
 * Same defect class as the task list itself: a Zustand store is a module singleton and signing
 * back in is a client-side navigation, so the module is never re-evaluated. The member filter
 * is the sharp edge - it holds a user id from the OLD roster, so the incoming account gets a
 * silently narrowed list, and the chip that is supposed to name the person resolves against a
 * roster that no longer contains them and renders a bare uuid instead.
 *
 * Delegated to the store's own `reset()` rather than a hand-written `setState` so the two
 * cannot drift as fields are added. Note the no-filter sentinel is the STRING 'all' - resetting
 * these to null or '' would typecheck and change nothing a reader could see.
