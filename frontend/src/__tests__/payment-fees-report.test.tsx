// "Collected on top of the invoice" summary block on the Payments report (F5, slug
// "payments"), sourced from GET /api/reports/payment-fees.
//
// Two tiles, one card (Plan A, 2026-08-04, D-A5): the card service fee (customer-paid,
// the org never sees it - it splits between Stripe and ServWave) and the customer tip
// (customer-paid, the org keeps all of it). What they share is the property that defines
// this card - collected on top of the invoice face value, never entering invoice totals
// (D1/D10). This block used to also break the payment down into Gross / Stripe fee /
// ServWave platform fee / Net; it no longer does - what the processor and the platform
// each take is ours to reconcile, not the org's to read.
