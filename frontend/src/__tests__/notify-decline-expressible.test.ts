/**
 * Q1 (RATIFIED, decline-expressible half) - `notifyKeysShown` / `notifyVisitBodyShown`.
 *
 * Before this fix, `notifyKeys(n)` returned `{}` both when no composer ever existed
 * (`n === undefined`) AND when a composer was shown and left off (`n.enabled === false`) -
 * an untick was byte-identical on the wire to a dialog that never opened. The backend reads an
 * absent `notify` as "let the automation handle it", which is exactly how a box labelled
 * "Notify the customer" ends up emailing the customer when it is left OFF.
 *
 * These pin the fix at the one place it is testable without a host: the shape the wire actually
 * carries for each of the three states the contract names -
 *   - composer shown, box off  -> explicit `notify_customer: false`
 *   - composer shown, box on   -> `notify_customer: true` + whatever recipient/message/cc keys
 *   - no composer ever shown   -> untouched, byte-identical to today (plain notifyKeys/
 *                                 notifyVisitBody, called with `undefined`)
 *
 * `notifyKeysShown` / `notifyVisitBodyShown` take a REQUIRED `NotifyCompose`, not an optional
 * one - calling them at all is the host asserting "a composer was on screen for this attempt".
 * The three real hosts (SchedulePage's reschedule-confirm dialog, its unschedule-confirm dialog,
 * and visitScheduleDialog.tsx) all wire through exactly this contract; see their own inline
 * comments at the call sites for how each decides whether to call the Shown variant.
