// Schema access comes from the shared non-test module, never re-rolled here.
// This file used to carry its own /^enum X \{([^}]*)\}/m parser, which is unsafe:
// a `//` comment containing a brace truncates the enum body early. The guard
// suite writes a dedicated test for exactly that failure ("a brace inside a
// comment does not truncate the body, the [^}] trap"), so one file's parser was
// contradicting the other file's proof. The shared parser is line-based.
//
// It is imported from a plain `.ts`, not from the sibling `.test.ts`: importing
// one test file from another re-registers that file's suites into the importer
// and double-runs them (measured: this file reported 152 tests instead of 101).

/**
 * Status registry - shape, intent role maps, and the resolution snapshot.
 *
 * THE SCHEMA BIJECTION IS NOT HERE. The domain -> Prisma-enum map, the synthetic
 * domain allowlist, the excluded-enum list and the both-directions assertions
 * have ONE home each:
 *
 *   declarations  design-system/__tests__/schema-enum-sources.ts
 *   assertions    design-system/__tests__/status-registry-schema-guard.test.ts
 *
 * They used to be duplicated here byte-for-byte, which meant a work package
 * whose whole thesis is "one place" shipped two hand-maintained copies of its
 * own classification map. Add a domain or an enum there, not here.
 *
 * What is left in this file:
 *   - the shape check over EVERY entry, synthetic domains included (the guard
 *     file has no shape check, and the synthetic domains have no schema to be
 *     checked against at all)
 *   - the negative controls that prove the both-directions assertion can fail,
 *     plus the two producer anchors a generic guard cannot discover on its own
 *   - the intent role maps: totality, no raw palette class, no raw hex
 *   - the full resolution snapshot (see the docblock above it for exactly what
 *     that snapshot does and does not cover)
