/**
 * The app's dialog primitive, painted with the v2 kit's modal surface.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE AND NOT SIXTY OTHERS. The v2 pages compose the kit's own
 * `ui-kit/components/ui/dialog`, but they also mount around sixty dialogs that
 * predate it - every inventory Add/Edit form, the estimate action dialogs, the
 * invoice credit and refund dialogs, the job dialogs - and each of those
 * renders through THIS primitive. So a v2 page would open a modal in the new
 * design one click and a modal in the old one the next: a lighter scrim, a
 * different corner radius, a different shadow, a different title weight. That
 * is not sixty bugs, it is one, and it is here.
 *
 * The surface below is therefore the kit's, token for token - scrim, blur,
 * radius, elevation, close affordance, title and description type. What is NOT
 * touched is the box model: `width`, `pad` and `gap` still mean exactly what
 * they meant, still default to `max-w-lg` / `p-6` / `gap-4`, and every call
 * site keeps its own spacing. Repainting a shared surface is safe; re-laying it
 * out under sixty callers is not.
 *
 * The kit's dialog splits its padding across header/body/footer slots and pins
 * the first and last while the middle scrolls. This one cannot: its callers
 * pour arbitrary grid rows straight into the content element, so there is no
 * body slot to hand the surplus height to. It scrolls as a whole panel
 * instead - which is what `ui/modal.tsx` has always done, and it is the same
 * guarantee that matters: nothing ends up off-screen and unreachable.
