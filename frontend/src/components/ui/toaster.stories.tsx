   Toaster - Storybook stories, full-coverage pass (Storybook phase, W2 plan).

   Storybook 8 is scaffolded now (.storybook/main.ts, .storybook/preview.ts,
   the @storybook/react-vite devDependency in package.json) - this file
   imports the real `Meta` / `StoryObj` types from `@storybook/react` and
   wires `argTypes` so every axis is a live control in the Storybook UI,
   matching badge.stories.tsx / dialog.stories.tsx / checkbox.stories.tsx.

   COVERAGE REQUIREMENT AND WHY THIS FILE LOOKS THE WAY IT DOES.

   toaster.tsx itself ships NO cva() block and NO props at all - `Toaster` is
   a zero-argument function component that reads `useToast()`'s shared state
   and maps it onto `<Toast>`. So, read narrowly, the completeness pass has
   zero keys and zero values to check against this specific file - the same
   "no cva -> vacuously satisfied" situation checkbox.stories.tsx documents
   for checkbox.tsx.

   But `Toaster` is not a decorative wrapper the way an empty-cva primitive
   normally is: it is the ONLY application call site that renders `Toast` -
   grep confirms it, every real feature/page importer of `./toast` (outside
   this session's own `.stories.tsx` files) reaches it only through
   `toaster.tsx` - and it is mounted exactly ONCE, at `App.tsx:286`. Every
   toast the product ever shows a user renders through this component. So
   the meaningful coverage question for "Toaster" is not "does Toaster have
   variants" (it doesn't) but "does every value of the variant it renders -
   `toastVariants` in toast.tsx, `variant: default | destructive` - actually
   get exercised through it." toast.stories.tsx (this file's sibling) already
   covers that cva block directly against the raw `Toast`/`ToastProvider`/
   `ToastViewport` primitives, which satisfies the completeness pass on its
   own; this file covers the same two values again, deliberately, but through
   the real composed path (`Toaster` + the `toast()` singleton call) rather
   than the raw primitives, since that composed path is what this specific
   file was assigned to story and is what a designer debugging a real toast
   actually sees, matching real production call shapes:

     variant="default"      no-op call sites just pass `description` (see
       ScopeOfWorkCard.tsx undo-toast, and the `Default` story below, which
       reproduces the exact shape src/__tests__/toast-autodismiss.test.tsx
       asserts on: `toast({ description: 'Text sent to Acme' })`).
     variant="destructive"  every error-path call site (SendInvoiceDialog.tsx:112,
       SendEstimateDialog.tsx:159, PurchaseOrdersPage.tsx, POEmailDialog.tsx:178)
       pairs it with `duration: Infinity` so the error stays up until the user
       dismisses it - reproduced in the `Destructive` story below.

   `toast()` (use-toast.ts) is an imperative, module-level singleton call -
   not a prop `<Toaster>` itself accepts. So "wire argTypes to the real prop
   type" here means: the Controls panel drives the arguments of that real
   `toast()` call (title/description/variant), not a prop on the `Toaster`
   JSX element (which takes none). `Default`/`WithTitleAndDescription`/
   `Destructive`/`DestructiveTitleOnly` share one `LiveToastDemo` render that
   re-fires `toast()` on every control change (dismissing the previous demo
   toast first), so flipping `variant` in the Controls panel replaces the
   visible toast live, the same way Dialog's `size`/`pad`/`gap` controls
   redraw its open dialog live.

   KNOWN LIMITATION, WORTH RECORDING RATHER THAN DISCOVERING BY SURPRISE.
   `memoryState` (use-toast.ts) is one JS-module-level singleton, not a React
   context scoped per component tree - by design, since the real app mounts
   exactly one `<Toaster/>` for the whole page. Every `<Toaster/>` instance in
   this file's stories subscribes to and renders that same shared array. On
   Storybook's single-story Canvas tab (how a designer normally browses -
   one story mounted at a time, unmounted when you pick another) this is
   invisible, and each story's own unmount cleanup below dismisses its own
   toast so it does not "follow" the next story you open. On the combined
   Docs/autodocs page, where several stories' canvases can be mounted at
   once, a toast fired in one block can appear in another block's `<Toaster/>`
   too - that is this primitive's real, tested architecture (see
   src/__tests__/toast-autodismiss.test.tsx's own comment on why it needs
   `vi.resetModules()` per test to get an isolated instance), not a story
   authoring bug.

   `duration: Infinity` is used through most of these stories so a toast
   stays up while a designer inspects the canvas or flips a control, rather
   than racing the real 4-second auto-dismiss timer (TOAST_AUTO_DISMISS in
   use-toast.ts). `AutoDismiss` is the one story that deliberately leaves
   `duration` unset, to show that real default timing on its own.
