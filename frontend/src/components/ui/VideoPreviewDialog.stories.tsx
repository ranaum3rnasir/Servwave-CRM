/* =============================================================================
   VideoPreviewDialog - Storybook stories, phase 12 gap-closing pass.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Phase 12's story audit found two shipped primitives
   under components/ui with no co-located .stories.tsx at all - this one and
   AttachmentLightbox. Both are full-screen portalled overlays, which is
   almost certainly why they were skipped: neither renders in place, so
   neither shows up in a story panel the way an inline primitive does.
   That is a reason to write the story carefully, not a reason to leave the
   component undiscoverable (program plan corollary 2).

   NO cva() BLOCK AND NO Record<Key,string> LOOKUP. videoPreviewDialog has
   one prop that changes what renders (`url`) and one callback (`onClose`) -
   no variant axis at all - so storybook-completeness.test.ts has nothing to
   enforce here and this file is not trying to satisfy it. The coverage that
   matters is the two real STATES: `url: null` (renders nothing) and a live
   url (renders the portalled overlay).

   THE OVERLAY IS PORTALLED TO document.body, SO IT ESCAPES THE STORY CANVAS.
   `createPortal(..., document.body)` means the markup does not land inside
   Storybook's story root - it covers the whole preview iframe, `fixed
   inset-0`. That is the real shipped behaviour and these stories show it
   honestly rather than faking an inline variant that does not exist. Each
   story below therefore renders its own trigger and holds open/closed state,
   which is also how every real call site uses it (the caller keeps it
   mounted unconditionally and passes `selectedUrl ?? null`).

   THE VIDEO SOURCE IS A GENERATED data: URI, NOT A NETWORK URL. Storybook
   here runs with no fixtures server and CI builds it offline, so pointing at
   a remote sample would render a broken player in the exact story meant to
   document a working one. `TINY_MP4` below is a real, playable 1-frame MP4
   inlined as base64 - small enough to read as source, real enough that
   `<video controls>` renders its actual chrome.

   RELATIONSHIP TO AttachmentLightbox, STATED SO NOBODY "FIXES" IT BY
   ACCIDENT. AttachmentLightbox.tsx's own header records that it was built by
   synthesizing this file with StageDetailDialog's inline image overlay, and
   that `<AttachmentLightbox kind="video">` renders the same
   `<video controls autoPlay>` this component does. So this component is a
   strict subset of that one and is a live duplicate-concept candidate - see
   that file's story for the superset. Consolidating them is NOT this file's
   job and is not attempted here; it is recorded as an observation for a
   future phase-12 structure pass.
