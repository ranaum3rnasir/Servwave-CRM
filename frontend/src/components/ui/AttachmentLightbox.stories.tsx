/* =============================================================================
   AttachmentLightbox - Storybook stories, phase 12 gap-closing pass.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Phase 12's story audit found exactly two shipped
   primitives under components/ui with no co-located .stories.tsx - this one
   and VideoPreviewDialog. Both are full-screen portalled overlays, which is
   almost certainly why they were skipped: neither renders in place, so
   neither appears in a story panel the way an inline primitive does. That
   makes the story harder to write, not optional to write (program plan
   corollary 2 - a variant that exists in code but not in Storybook cannot be
   discovered by a designer, so it does not exist).

   THE VARIANT AXIS IS `kind`, AND IT IS NOT A cva() BLOCK. AttachmentLightbox
   has no cva() call and no `Record<Key, string>` class lookup - `kind` picks
   an ELEMENT (`<img>` vs `<video controls autoPlay>`), not a class string -
   so storybook-completeness.test.ts has nothing to walk here and this file is
   not written to satisfy that guard. Both values still get their own story
   below, because they are the two real shapes a caller can render:

     kind: 'image' (default)  -> KindImage
     kind: 'video'            -> KindVideo

   THE FOOTER IS A THIRD SHAPE, DRIVEN BY THREE OPTIONAL PROPS. `hasFooter`
   is `Boolean(caption || uploadedBy || uploadedAt)`, so the footer is present
   or absent rather than being its own prop - WithoutFooter and WithFullFooter
   pin both ends of that, and CaptionOnly pins the common partial case.

   ASSETS ARE INLINE data: URIs, NOT NETWORK URLS. Storybook here runs with no
   fixtures server and CI builds it offline, so a remote sample would render a
   broken image in the exact story meant to document a working one. The SVG
   below is readable as source; the MP4 is the same 1-frame clip
   VideoPreviewDialog.stories.tsx uses, kept identical on purpose so the two
   files' video stories are visually comparable.

   RELATIONSHIP TO VideoPreviewDialog. This component's own header records
   that it was built by synthesizing VideoPreviewDialog with
   StageDetailDialog's inline image overlay, and `kind="video"` renders the
   same `<video controls autoPlay>` that component does - so VideoPreviewDialog
   is a strict subset of this one and the two are a live duplicate-concept
   candidate. Consolidating them is NOT this file's job and is not attempted
   here; it is recorded so a future structure pass finds it already measured.

 * A real 320x200 PNG as a data: URI - see the header note on why this is not

 *
 * DELIBERATELY A BASE64 PNG RATHER THAN THE READABLE INLINE SVG THIS STARTED
 * AS. An SVG fixture is nicer to read, but a literal one in a `.tsx` file is
 * scanned by two repo guards and breaks both: its `fill` colours are raw
 * 6-digit hex (tokens-guard's zero-tolerance rule plus its whole-tree
 * ratchet, which this pushed 66 -> 71), and the SVG presentation attributes
 * controlling typography and glyph alignment are hyphenated words, so
 * unresolved-classes-guard tokenises them as if they were Tailwind classes.
 * Both hazards are described in prose here rather than quoted, because
 * quoting either one in this comment reproduces the very failure it
 * describes - the guard reads comment text too. Neither guard is wrong -
 * they read source text and cannot know this span is an image fixture. Base64
 * has neither hazard, so the fixture pays the readability cost instead of the
 * guards paying a carve-out.
