/* =============================================================================
   PopoverContent - W2 primitive vocabulary: `width` (max-width) x `pad` (padding).

   Named `width`, not `size` - program plan section 2a rule 3: `size` always
   means control height (the absolute px ladder every sized primitive can
   share) and never means anything else. A max-width scale is `width`, per
   the per-primitive scope table's Popover row.

   Re-verified 25 real PopoverContent call sites across 23 files (program plan
   section 1b's PopoverContent row: 25 sites / 23 files / size 24 / colour 1;
   grep "PopoverContent" frontend/src, excluding this file, each site's
   className read by hand).

   WHY `md` / `4` EMIT NO CLASS FOR EITHER AXIS. The base string below keeps
   `w-72` and `p-4` exactly where they sat before this change. `width="md"`
   and `pad={4}` both resolve to an empty string in the variant tables, so
   the no-props render is byte-identical to what shipped before. A non-default
   value is appended AFTER the base string and wins through `cn`'s
   tailwind-merge pass (same `w-*` / `p-*` conflict group as `w-72` / `p-4`),
   not by sitting in the original position - only the DEFAULT render's exact
   byte order is a frozen contract here, not every combination's class order.

   WIDTH (today's hardcoded default is w-72 / 288px):
     w-64 x5  SettingsGearDropdown, TagInput, PaymentFeeBreakdown, NumbersView x2
     w-72 x3  explicit, matches today's default - CategoryManagerDropdown,
              CategorySelector, phone/shared
     w-80 x3  LinkedEntitySelect, AssignTeamPopover, NotificationBell
   The other 14 sites are not size-shaped and keep using a className width
   override indefinitely: 4 match trigger width
   (`w-[var(--radix-popover-trigger-width)]`), 5 are bespoke large filter/menu
   panels (each a singleton pixel width), 2 are `w-auto`, 3 are singletons
   below w-64 (w-56, w-52, w-36) with no repeated signature.

   `xs` IS DEFERRED, NOT IMPLEMENTED. The only candidates below `sm` are three
   different singleton widths (w-56, w-52, w-36) - no 3+ repeated signature -
   so no pixel value is picked yet. Same treatment button.tsx gives its
   zero-demand cells (see its header note on the `soft` structure and the
   success / warning / info tones): the rung is documented here, not minted,
   until a real call site asks for one.

   PAD, expressed as the numeric 4px-grid step (program plan section 2a.8 -
   `pad` is a number, not a size word, matching Dialog/Stack/Card; today's
   hardcoded default is p-4, i.e. step 4):
     pad={0} x12  p-0, the dominant signature - custom lists/menus with
                  their own inner spacing
     pad={1} x4   p-1
     pad={2} x5, plus the 2 p-3 sites (DateTimePicker, AssignTeamPopover)
                  rounded down to this rung - closer neighbour by both pixel
                  distance and usage pattern (both are compact single-field
                  pickers)
     pad={4} x2   p-4, explicit, matches today's default - PaymentFeeBreakdown
                  (implicit), CallsView (explicit)
   No demand above step 4 at all - deferred for the same reason `xs` is
   above, not implemented here.

   COLOUR: 1 site only (phone/shared.tsx, `ring-border`), not a repeated
   signature or a tone request. No `variant` / `tone` / `gap` demand found
   anywhere in the call sites, so none of those axes are added here.
