// What the all-day strip PILL contains.
//
// The strip forces every pill to height: 22px (schedule-dark.css). The full event
// card is ~82px of content - number, time range, crew, address stacked - so a card
// rendered into a pill spills over the day headers and neighbouring pills. Prod hit
// exactly that: cross-midnight jobs started reaching the strip (they are routed there
// by rbc) while ScheduleEvent still gave them the full card, because the strip's
// visibility used occupiesAllDayStrip and the renderer still used isAllDayEvent.
//
// Anything rbc puts in the strip must render as ONE line - and, since the pill was measured
// at 96.3px against a 254px "number EM customer" string, that line is the NUMBER ALONE. The
// customer name lives on the hover preview and in the overflow panel, both of which have room
// for it; on the pill it only ever pushed the number out.

// occupiesAllDayStrip while the v2 fork users actually reach still used isAllDayEvent.

  // to the overflow panel, which has 288px. An earlier version of this dropped the badge only
