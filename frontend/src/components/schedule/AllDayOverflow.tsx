/**
 * All-day strip overflow — the `+N more` chip and its day panel.
 *
 * Spec: md_files/plans/scheduler/2026-08-24-allday-strip-overflow-spec.md
 *
 * The strip is capped at three rows (`allDayMaxRows={ALL_DAY_MAX_ROWS}` on the
 * calendar). Everything past the cap collapses into a `+N more` chip, which is a
 * *disclosure*, not a record: N stands for N things, so it can never resolve to
 * one. It opens a disambiguation list (Layer 1); a row in that list opens the
 * event editor (Layer 2).
 *
 * Interaction — hover previews, click pins:
 *   hover 350ms      → transient panel
 *   mouse out 200ms  → transient panel closes (hovering the panel cancels this,
 *                      WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.13 "hoverable")
 *   click            → pins; survives mouse-out, and clicking again keeps it
 *   keyboard focus   → opens pinned (a keyboard user has no mouse-out)
 *   Esc / outside    → closes either way ("dismissible")
 * Click pins rather than toggles because with hover already opening the panel, a
 * toggling click would close the panel under the cursor and then reopen it on the
 * next mouse jiggle.

/**
 * The label a panel row shows: number, em dash, customer. The em dash is `EM` from
 * pages/v2/schedule/glyphs.ts, U+2014; the page's e2e selectors match on rendered text
 * rather than testids.
 *
 * Deliberately FULLER than the pill it stands in for, and no longer a mirror of it. The pill
 * was measured at 96.3px against this 254px string, so it now carries the bare number; this
 * panel is 288px and is where the customer name is actually legible. Reading the two as "one
 * must match the other" is what made the pill unreadable in the first place.
 *
 * Which TRIP it is deliberately is NOT in this string: the row renders `visitLabel(e)` as a
 * separate shrink-0 sibling, so the one thing that tells two visits of one job apart survives
 * the truncation that eats the customer name. The panel keeps the full sentence
 * (`Visit 2 of 5`); only the pill abbreviates it, via visitLabelCompact.
 *
 * Slice 03 (calendar-entries spec \u00a72, ADR 0002) - a calendar entry crossing midnight lands
 * in this strip TODAY, with no `is_all_day` flag required: `occupiesAllDayStrip` mirrors
 * react-big-calendar's own `!isSameDay(start, end)` routing, independent of the flag, and
 * that predicate is already live. An entry carries no record number and no customer (\u00a72 -
 * the card renders the title alone), so it gets its own branch rather than falling through
 * the `job ? ... : ...` ternary below - the fall-through silently means "walkthrough", which
 * is exactly wrong for a fourth type: it printed "Walkthrough \u2014 " (dangling em dash, empty
 * customer) for an entry with neither a `lead_number` nor a `raw.customer`. Checked first so
 * this NEVER reaches that fallback. `ScheduleEvent`'s own calendar-entry branch in
 * SchedulePage.tsx returns before its occupiesAllDayStrip check for the identical reason, so
 * the two agree here: title alone, in both places, for every calendar entry.
