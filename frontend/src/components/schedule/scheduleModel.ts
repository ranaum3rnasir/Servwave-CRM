// locked scheduler-assignment redesign (PRD: md_files/plans/scheduler/).
// Crew (0..N performers) and schedule (a time or null) are INDEPENDENT axes (§3.8 four-state).
// Time is modeled as real Dates (an earlier {dayIndex,minutes} sketch was a design-time abstraction).
//
// start/end are WallClock, not a raw Instant: every event that reaches this module has already
// crossed the org-timezone boundary in eventAdapters.ts. See frontend/src/lib/schedule-tz.ts for
// what that means and why — react-big-calendar (the consumer downstream of this module) has no
// timezone concept, so the whole board operates in wall-clock space between the two boundaries.

//
// CORRECTED post-slice-03 (§9 risk 4): the original bronze/taupe value (~4.7:1 estimated on

// identical to the completed treatment's neutral-surface grey (both are compositing something
// at low alpha over the same near-white canvas - no candidate hue closed that gap past ~30 on a

// a background they can tell apart from "this job is done" at a glance. A non-colour signal (a
// distinct border style, or a visible "Event" label on the card - today's number/type badge slot
// is blank for a calendar entry, since it carries no record number) would close that gap more
// robustly, but touches the Standard-view renderer in SchedulePage.tsx, which another team's PR

 * callers via eventDangerState and never reaches this helper; what is left is the status
 * axis and the type axis, in that order.
 *
 * Why the registry is the wrong source here, concretely:
 *   - EVENT_TYPE_META (see just above) paints job=info, walkthrough=warning and
 *     service-plan=ai. That is the type-accent language the on-screen board legend
 *     advertises to the user. Resolving per status through the registry would repaint
 *     every SCHEDULED and UNSCHEDULED block amber and delete those type accents outright.
 *   - COMPLETED_STATUSES (below) deliberately buckets COMPLETED and CANCELLED together as
 *     one "this is over" treatment for jobs (isCompletedEvent adds the walkthrough case
 *     separately, off walkthrough_completed_at rather than a status value - see there). The
 *     registry splits the job bucket into a success tone and a neutral tone.
 *   - The in-flight treatment here is green; the registry maps the in-flight statuses to amber,
 *     where they would collide with SCHEDULED.
 * So a registry migration of this helper is a repaint of the busiest screen in the app,
 * not a consolidation. Any change to it is a deliberate design decision, not a cleanup.
