/* =============================================================================
   Toolbar - Storybook stories, phase 12 composition-layer pass.

   ZERO APPEARANCE TOKENS AUTHORED IN THIS FILE'S OWN className ATTRIBUTES,
   by constraint: `DIR_CEILINGS['components/patterns'] = 0` and
   component-api-guard's `targetFiles()` does not exempt `.stories.tsx`.
   See .storybook/main.ts's header for the full asymmetry note.

   ONE HONEST WRINKLE, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. Toolbar's own header
   documents that a leading search icon needs the caller to supply BOTH the
   styled icon and the matching left padding on the input (`pl-8`), because
   padding matches the guard's `APPEARANCE_RE` and Toolbar is forbidden from
   hardcoding it. A story is a caller, so `WithSearchIcon` below supplies
   both through the documented pass-through props exactly as
   `pages/inventory/VendorsPage.tsx` does. That padding travels as a value
   inside `searchInputProps`, never as this file's own `className=` attribute
   - which is the same channel the real call sites use, not a way around the
   ceiling. If that ever starts counting, the right fix is to give the
   pattern a real leading-icon slot with its own padding contract, NOT to
   carve `.stories.tsx` out of the guard.

   THE SEARCH HALF IS OPT-IN, AND THAT IS A REAL STORY. `Toolbar` renders no
   search box at all unless `onSearchChange` is passed - `FiltersOnly` below
   pins that, because a fixed search slot every adopter must fill was
   explicitly not the design.

   `filters` AND `actions` ARE PLAIN SLOTS, NOT A CLOSED LIST. The measured
   occupants are heterogeneous (a Select, a segmented toggle, a Switch, a
   bare count) and none of it is Toolbar's to restyle - it owns the ROW, not
   what sits in it. The stories reflect that by putting different things in
   the same slot rather than showing one blessed arrangement.

/**

 * typing.
 *
 * That state lives in this NAMED component rather than inline in each
 * story's `render` arrow, because a hook called inside an anonymous
 * `render` function violates `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`: React only
 * guarantees hook identity inside a component or another hook, and an arrow
 * assigned to a `render` key is neither - even though Storybook renders it
 * as one, which is what makes the mistake easy to ship.
