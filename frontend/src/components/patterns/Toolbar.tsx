   Toolbar - phase 10. The search-and-filter-row half of the composition
   layer (program plan section "Phase 10 - Complete the composition layer":
   "15 pages with a search input").

   NAMED `Toolbar`, NOT `FilterBar`. The plan's own heading writes
   "Toolbar / FilterBar" as two names for one idea, but
   `components/filters/FilterBar.tsx` already exists in this tree for a
   DIFFERENT concept - a facet-popover trigger button, not a search+filter
   row. Reusing "FilterBar" here would collide with that file's own name and
   mean two different things depending on which import a reader followed.
   `Toolbar` is unambiguous and unclaimed.

   MEASURED SHAPE (3 parallel Explore agents, 2026-07-30, re-checked against
   the live tree rather than carried from the plan's 2026-07-27 count). The
   common signature across the hand-rolled rows:
     `<div className="relative flex-1 ..."><Search className="absolute ..."
     /><input value=... onChange=... className="rounded-md border ..." /></div>`
   inside a row also carrying assorted filter controls (a Select, a
   segmented toggle, a popover trigger) and sometimes a trailing count.
   Real sites: `pages/inventory/InventoryPage.tsx`,
   `pages/inventory/PurchaseOrdersPage.tsx`,
   `pages/inventory/VendorsPage.tsx`, `pages/inventory/PriceBookPage.tsx`
   (groups tab). The 5 `ListPageShell`-delegating pages (Customers/Estimates/
   Invoices/Jobs/Leads) and `pages/reports/_shared.tsx`'s own `ReportToolbar`
   already have an equivalent path and are not this component's job.

   WHY THIS FILE OWNS NO SEARCH-ICON COLOUR, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A
   WORKAROUND. `components/patterns` is ratcheted to a directory-wide
   appearance ceiling of 0 (component-api-guard.test.ts's `DIR_CEILINGS`) -
   every JSX tag this file authors is scanned, and any `text` colour class is
   classified APPEARANCE by that guard's own `APPEARANCE_RE`, with no carve-
   out for an icon. No Icon-tone primitive exists to delegate to either: the
   plan's own phase-7 evidence (`§7f`) records that an Icon primitive was
   built and reverted during phase 7 (name collision with the ubiquitous
   `const Icon = report.icon` pattern, reddened the layering guard repo-
   wide), and phase 9's table lists an Icon tone axis as still open. Building
   one here, inside a phase-10 composition pattern, would be exactly the kind
   of scope-widening CLAUDE.md's boundary rules ask to be surfaced rather
   than self-authorised. So `searchIcon` is a slot: the caller supplies an
   already-styled node (their own file, their own className, not scanned by
   this ceiling), and this file only wraps it in a LAYOUT-only positioning
   span (`absolute`, `left-`, `top-`, a transform - none of which match the
   guard's appearance prefixes). Same reasoning for `searchInputProps`: the
   left padding a leading icon needs (`pl-8`) is a PADDING class
   (`p[trblxy]?-` matches APPEARANCE_RE), so it cannot be hardcoded here
   either - it is the caller's to pass alongside their own icon, through a
   prop whose static value never appears in this file's own source text.

   `Input`, NOT A RAW `<input>`. Every measured site hand-styles its own
   `<input>` instead of using the shipped primitive - the exact bypass this
   whole program exists to close. Passing `searchInputProps` through lets a
   call site choose a `size` rung (VendorsPage's compact box is closest to
   `xs`, 32px) without this file inventing a new one.

   `filters` / `actions` ARE PLAIN SLOTS, NOT A CLOSED LIST. The measured
   filter controls are heterogeneous (a custom dropdown, a segmented toggle
   built from raw buttons, a Switch, a count `<span>`) and none of it is this
   component's to restyle - Toolbar owns the ROW, not what sits in it.
   Converting a segmented raw-button toggle to a real primitive is phase 11's
   job, not something this pattern should do as a side effect of adoption.

   ZERO APPEARANCE TOKENS AUTHORED HERE, CHECKED AGAINST THE GUARD, NOT
   ASSUMED. `relative`, `min-w-[240px]`, `flex-1`, `absolute`, `left-2.5`,
   `top-1/2`, `ml-auto`, `flex`, `items-center`, `gap-2` all classify as
   LAYOUT under `LAYOUT_RE`. `pointer-events-none` and `-translate-y-1/2`
   match neither list (classified `other`) and are likewise not counted.
   `components/patterns` inherits the directory ceiling of 0 on the day this
   file is added, the same way `DetailPageShell.tsx` and the two phase-7
   files already do.
