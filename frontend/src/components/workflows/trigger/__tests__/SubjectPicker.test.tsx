/**
 * A trimmed but shape-faithful catalog (same trimming approach as
 * ../../step-forms.fixture.ts's FORM_CATALOG — only the `triggers` field
 * SubjectPicker actually reads, cast past the rest of WorkflowCatalog's
 * shape). Per-subject event counts are deliberately chosen to (a) differ
 * from each other and (b) differ from the approved mockup's hardcoded tile
 * hints (Jobs "5 events", Estimates "4 events", Invoices "3 events", Leads
 * "7 events") — if SubjectPicker ever hardcodes those mockup numbers instead
 * of deriving them from `catalog.triggers`, these assertions catch it. Each
 * subject also carries one non-`'events'`-category trigger (timed or date)
 * to prove the tile count excludes anything that isn't a plain event.
