/**
 * One-click attach / reassign menu — lists a customer's OPEN jobs as
 * "number · location" plus an explicit detach reset. Lifted originally from
 * CallsView's call-drawer CallJobMenu (slice E3) so the entity-tab comm rows
 * (Job / Customer / Lead pages) share the exact hub behavior; the id only
 * travels in the reassign payload, never the UI.
 *
 * Two later widenings, both from the same live-QA report ("why can't I attach a
 * call to a job/lead?"):
 *
 *  - LEADS are targets too. A job and its originating lead are two ends of one
 *    thing, and the server stamps the pair whichever end is picked, so this
 *    offers both and reports which kind was chosen. Callers that cannot attach a
 *    lead (SMS and email have no lead endpoint) pass no leads and the group
 *    simply does not render.
 *  - SEARCH, always. Every open of this menu can reach every job and lead in the
 *    org. It began as an unknown-caller fallback and was wrong that way round:
 *    the rows WITH a customer were the ones stuck, listing only that customer's
 *    work with no way to reach anything else or to correct a mis-attach. A
 *    customer now only seeds the default list. See useAttachTargets.
