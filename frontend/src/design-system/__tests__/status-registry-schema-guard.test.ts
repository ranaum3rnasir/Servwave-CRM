/* =============================================================================
   Status registry <-> schema.prisma bijection guard.

   The registry (design-system/status-registry.ts) is the single source of truth
   for "what does this domain state look like". Its KEYS are Prisma enum values.
   Nothing in the type system connects the two: the registry maps are
   `Record<string, StatusEntry>`, so a new enum value, a renamed one, or a
   deleted one is a silent, green, runtime-only hole. That hole is the bug this
   work package exists to close, so it gets a guard rather than a convention.

   PARSES schema.prisma AT TEST TIME. It deliberately does not carry a copy of
   the enums: a hardcoded copy drifts the moment the schema moves, which is the
   exact failure mode being fenced. If the schema file cannot be read, this file
   fails loudly rather than skipping.

   --- what is asserted -------------------------------------------------------
   1. Every enum declared in schema.prisma is CLASSIFIED - claimed by a registry
      domain, or listed in EXCLUDED_ENUMS with a written reason. A brand new
      enum therefore fails the build until someone decides which it is.
   2. Every enum name this file names actually EXISTS in schema.prisma. A
      renamed or deleted enum fails.
   3. Both directions, per in-scope domain:
        forward  every schema enum value has a registry entry
        reverse  every registry key is a schema enum value, or is declared
                 client-derived and proven genuinely absent from the enum
   4. Every registry domain is either enum-sourced or on the synthetic
      allowlist, and never both.
   5. The four status vocabularies copilot/tools/toolRegistry.ts advertises to
      the model are exactly their Prisma enums, in declaration order. That guard
      lives HERE because this is the file that already parses schema.prisma.
   6. Neither classification map is empty. Every assertion above iterates one of
      them, so a half-deleted map would pass vacuously over nothing; the counts
      are asserted so that failure mode is loud rather than green.

   --- where the classification map lives -------------------------------------
   DOMAIN_ENUM_SOURCE, SYNTHETIC_DOMAINS and parseSchemaEnums are NOT declared
   here. They live in the shared non-test module ./schema-enum-sources.ts and are
   imported by BOTH guards (this one and src/__tests__/status-registry.test.ts),
   because two hand-maintained copies of a "one place" work package's own
   classification map is the exact defect this work package exists to remove.
   They are re-exported at the bottom of this file for callers that reach for the
   guard by name; new importers should take the shared module directly.

   --- what is IN SCOPE (13 enums, 12 domains) --------------------------------
   LeadStatus, EstimateStatus, JobStatus, InvoiceStatus, TaskStatus,
   TaskPriority, ServicePlanStatus, LogisticOrderStatus, AssetStatus,
   PunchReview, EmailDeliveryStatus, and the pair WorkflowStepRunStatus +
   AutomationRunStatus which together back the single `workflowStep` domain
   (the workflow activity feed is a union of both row types).

   --- what is DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED (48 enums) -------------------------------
   Every one is listed by name in EXCLUDED_ENUMS below with its reason, so the
   exclusion is reviewable rather than implied by absence. The reasons fall into
   five groups: entity-type / polymorphic-owner discriminators, reason and
   provenance taxonomies, units and calculation modes, lifecycles with zero UI,
   and two special cases (WorkflowStatus is DERIVED, OtReviewState is a subset
   of a vocabulary already covered).

   --- what this guard CANNOT prove -------------------------------------------
   Five registry domains (deposit, approval, purchaseOrder, stage,
   estimateReservation) have no Prisma enum at all, and `workflow`
   is derived. A plain schema bijection passes vacuously over exactly those -
   including `purchaseOrder` and `stage`, the two most-duplicated domains in the
   app. They are allowlisted here, not silently skipped, and their key sets are
   unfenced by this file. Do not read a green run as proof they are right.

// --- the copilot status vocabulary is an API contract ----------------------------

/**
 * toolRegistry.ts derives the status filter vocabulary it advertises to the model
 * from the registry's key ORDER and key SET. That makes the registry load-bearing
 * for an API contract, not just for appearance: any new client-derived key (the
 * `invoice.OVERDUE` pattern) silently becomes an advertised filter value unless
 * toolRegistry's hand-maintained `exclude` array drops it - and /api/{resource}
 * validates the `status` facet against the Prisma enum, so an advertised value
 * that is not an enum value is a 400 the model cannot see coming. Nothing tested
 * that. This does.
 *
 * The guard lives in this file because this is the file that already parses
 * schema.prisma. It checks TWO things that have to be checked differently:
 *
 *   1. THE RENDERED DESCRIPTION, parsed back out of TOOL_SPECS.query_crm. This
 *      is the one that makes `exclude` self-checking, and it is the only way to
 *      do so: the exclude array is spelled at the CALL SITE, so a guard that
 *      re-spells `['OVERDUE']` and calls the generator itself would only be
 *      asserting its own copy. Parsing the rendered string reads the real call.
 *      It is also literally what the model is told.
 *   2. THE GENERATOR, called directly, to prove the vocabulary is registry-
 *      derived and preserves declaration order independently of the prose. Its
 *      enum-valued members, in order, must be the enum.
 *
 * Both directions are covered: a missing value (the SUPERSEDED bug this work
 * package fixed), an extra value, a reordering, or a forgotten `exclude` all
 * produce an inequality.
