/**
 * Single source of truth for "what does this domain state mean, visually."
 * Every status/state badge in the app resolves through here - see
 * md_files/specs/frontend/2026-07-26-ui-single-source-of-truth-goal.md.
 *
 * A status VALUE can mean different things in different domains (SENT is
 * neutral-in-flight for an Estimate but the same amber "needs payment" as
 * every other in-flight Invoice state) so each domain gets its own complete
 * map. Nothing here falls back to a shared cross-domain default - that
 * fallback is exactly the collision hazard this registry replaces.
 *
 * INCLUSION RULE (applied to all 51 Prisma enums; 39 are deliberately absent,
 * leaving 12 enums across 11 domains in scope). Those three counts are not
 * decorative and nothing asserts them, so they are stated with their source:
 * `grep -cE '^enum ' backend/prisma/schema.prisma` = 51, and EXCLUDED_ENUMS in
 * design-system/__tests__/status-registry-schema-guard.test.ts = 39, each with a
 * written reason. Re-run both before editing this sentence.
 * A domain belongs here iff ALL THREE hold:
 *   (a) its values are a lifecycle-state or graded-severity vocabulary for one entity,
 *   (b) at least one live UI surface maps it to appearance today,
 *   (c) real duplication exists (two or more places spell the same mapping).
 * Taxonomies (AttachmentContext, InvoiceKind, AssetEventType, WorkflowStepType,
 * NotificationCategory), label-only vocabularies (PaymentMethod), and enums with
 * zero UI (PlanVisitStatus, StockSyncStatus, WorkflowEnrollmentStatus,
 * CopilotMsgStatus) are NOT states and must not be added. Report re-bucketings
 * (estimates-report-logic, InvoicesReport, CommissionsReport) are deliberate
 * reporting taxonomies, not enum labels, and must not be converted.
 *
 * Five domains are SYNTHETIC - they have no Prisma enum behind them (deposit,
 * approval, purchaseOrder, stage, estimateReservation) and two are
 * DERIVED (workflow, invoice.OVERDUE). A guard written as a plain schema
 * bijection would therefore pass vacuously over exactly the worst-duplicated
 * domains. The guard in design-system/__tests__/status-registry-schema-guard.test.ts
 * uses a declared domain -> enum map plus an explicit synthetic allowlist instead;
 * the domain -> enum map, the synthetic allowlist and the schema parser live in
 * design-system/__tests__/schema-enum-sources.ts; EXCLUDED_ENUMS lives in
 * design-system/__tests__/status-registry-schema-guard.test.ts.

/**
 * WARNING - these maps are not appearance-only. Four of them feed an API contract.
 *
 * statusVocabulary() in components/copilot/tools/toolRegistry.ts builds the LLM's
 * advertised status filter vocabulary as
 * `Object.keys(STATUS_REGISTRY[domain]).filter(...).join('|')`
 * for `lead`, `job`, `estimate` and `invoice`. Both the key SET and the key ORDER
 * are load-bearing there: the set is what Servy will send to `GET /api/{resource}`,
 * and the order is what the tool description reads like to the model.
 *
 * The consequence, which is easy to miss: a CLIENT-DERIVED key added here for
 * rendering (the `invoice.OVERDUE` pattern - computed from due_date, not an
 * InvoiceStatus value) is silently advertised as a real filter value unless it is
 * also added to that call's `exclude` array, and the list endpoint validates the
 * facet against the Prisma enum, so the model gets a 400 on a value this file told
 * it existed. Conversely a key REMOVED here silently disappears from the model's
 * vocabulary. Rules for these four domains:
 *   - adding a real enum value: no action, the vocabulary widens correctly;
 *   - adding a client-derived key: add it to `exclude` in the same change;
 *   - reordering keys: keep the Prisma declaration order, that is the invariant
 *     toolRegistry's comment relies on.
